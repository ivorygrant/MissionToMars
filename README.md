# Mission To Mars

In this project, I use several skills to scrape data from the Internet about
my favorite red planet, and display my results in a mobile-friendly format.

The libraries/frameworks/apps I use are:

  * Flask
  * Requests
  * MongoDB
  * BeautifulSoup
  * Splinter/Selenium
  * Bootstrap 4

# File Structure

The home route is app.py, and the scraping function is in scraper.py. The jupyter
notebook is simply used to demonstrate the code. To run this application, download
all files and run app.py from the terminal.
